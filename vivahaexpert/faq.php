    <p   style="font-size:14px;">
     <b><a id="11" name="11"></a>Important tips to remember when creating a profile:</b><br />
     <br /> 
    
The number of replies you get from other members will entirely depend upon the quality and completeness of your profile. Here are some useful tips that will help you get the best possible results:
</p>
<ul   style="font-size:14px;">
<li>	Upload a photograph! We cannot stress the importance of this enough - People like to see who they're writing to and, as a result, profiles that have photographs attached get up to 10 times more clicks than profiles that don't. We’ve made it extremely easy to submit photographs, so please take advantage of this feature. Please make sure that your digital photo is in .JPG or .GIF format and a file size of less than 2Mb. If you are not sure how to change a file format or size – send your picture to our Support Team and we will upload it for you, free!</li>
<li>	Create a catchy title for your profile! When members search listings on the site, the title of your profile is listed alongside your name. As a general rule, profile titles like "Hi!" do not catch people's attention, where as more personalized titles do.</li>
<li>	Think before you write! Feel free to write as much as you want in our sign-up pages. Tell other members about yourself, your likes and dislikes, things you enjoy doing, what line of work you're in, what your personality is like, even your hopes and dreams. The better your profile describes you, the more likely it is that others will read and respond to it. If you can't think of anything right away, you can always add more lately. And don't forget to fill out the Partner Matching Criteria section - this will also help other members get to know you better. </li>

</ul>
<br />

 <p   style="font-size:14px;">
     <b><a id="12" name="12"></a>Where do I go to change my personal information?</b><br />

<p   style="font-size:14px;"><b><a id="30" name="30"></a>How do I send an email to members?</b><br /><br />
You can send emails to other members by clicking the button “Send Message” on that person's profile or listing. Simply type in your message and click on the yellow button labelled "Send".</p><br /><br />

<p   style="font-size:14px;"><b><a id="31" name="31"></a>How do I receive emails from other members?</b><br /><br />
You don’t need to do anything to receive emails from other members. If someone responds to your profile, we automatically forward their message to your real email account. When you reply to the message, we automatically forward it to the person who responded to you. In this way, neither person finds out the other person's email address without permission.<br /><br />

You can also view the status of messages in your Inbox and Outbox folders. Messages in your Inbox folder can be New, Read or Replied, and in your Outbox they are either Sent or Read (meaning the recipient has read them).
